ros-hydro-controller-interface (0.4.0-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Version 0.4.0
  * 1.0.1
  * Fix package URL in package.xml
  * adding install targets
  * merging CMakeLists.txt files from rosbuild and catkin
  * adding hybrid-buildsystem makefiles
  * Fix package URLs.
  * Refactor named resource management code.
    - In preparation for the explicitly typed actuators interface, code for managing
    named resources has been refactored into a separate class. This code consists
    of convenience methods wrapping a std::map container, and occur often enough
    that factoring it out to prevent duplication makes sense.
    - Code that is not part of the public API, and hence with no stability guarantees
    has been moved to the internal folder/namespace. It only affects the named
    resource management and symbol demanglind methods so far.
  * catkinizing, could still be cleaned up
  * Use demangled type names when available. Fixes #36 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_control/issues/36>.
    Type names are used in different interfaces  such as hardware_interface and
    controller_interface. When symbol demangling is available (currently gcc 3.0+),
    operate on demangled names, as they are more convenient for human reading, eg.
    hardware_interface::VelocityJointInterface
    instead of
    N18hardware_interface22VelocityJointInterfaceE
  * [Trivial] Remove redundant semicolon.
  * Update controller_interface docs.
    More descriptive documentation for initialization methods with two NodeHandle
    arguments.
  * add option to pass in two nodehandles to a controller: one in the root of the controller manager namespace, and one in the namespace of the controller itself. This copies the behavior used by nodelets and nodes
  * Fix typo in rosdoc config files.
  * Adding template parameter doc
  * Adding lots of inline documentation, rosdoc files
    adding inline doc to robot_hw
    adding inline doc to robot_hw
    adding inline doc to robot_hw

  * working install target
  * base classes
  * first catkin stuff
